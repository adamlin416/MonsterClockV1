This is a almost done Android App... a hobby project in my gap year.
But google requests for real user's feedback and test in early release(like >20 users), and I also got a job so it just stopped there.
Mainly a 8-bit monster evolve game. Unlock new evolution also unlock new clock widget.

Here're some monsters:
